    The Yukatabura of the Heian period is the prototype. Yubiko was used by
    nobles when taking a bath, but the bath at that time was like a sauna.
    Hemp was used for the Yubiko in the Heian period.

    Since the Azuchi-Momoyama era, it has been widely used to absorb water from
    the skin after bathing, and this has become a type of clothing that the
    common people love in the Edo era.

    When cotton began to spread in Japan in the Edo era, it became possible to
    wear cotton kimono with good water absorption instead of hemp after bathing,
    which has led to modern yukata. Originally, since the yukata was a room
    wear that you would wear after taking a bath, it was frustrating to wear a
    yukata from the daytime and go out, but that awareness is diminishing.

    In the modern era, yukata is one of the fashionable items to wear in the
    summer, and many women's yukata have gorgeous patterns and colors.
